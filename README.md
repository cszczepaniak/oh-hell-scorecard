A web app to score a game of Oh Hell (aka Up and Down the River, Oh Heck, etc.)
The purpose of this project is to create a web app to score a game of [Oh Hell](https://www.pagat.com/exact/ohhell.html) (aka Up and Down the River, Oh Heck, etc.). It's also serving as a way for me to learn about and explore a few web technologies:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and associated tooling
- Other devops tools ([Husky](https://www.npmjs.com/package/husky), [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged), [eslint](https://eslint.org/), CI/CD strategies ([Docker](https://www.docker.com/)), etc.)
- [React context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) as opposed to [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) for state management. I want to see what it takes to create a Redux-less application!

To run the app, simply run `npm start` and navigate to `localhost:3000` in a browser.
