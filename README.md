Source for [oh-heck.com](oh-heck.com): a web app to score a game of Oh Hell (aka Up and Down the River, Oh Heck, etc.)
The purpose of this project is to create a web app to score a game of [Oh Hell](https://www.pagat.com/exact/ohhell.html) (aka Up and Down the River, Oh Heck, etc.). It's also serving as a way for me to learn about and explore a few web technologies:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and associated tooling
- [AWS CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk) for deployment

---

To run the app locally, simply run `npm start` and navigate to `localhost:3000` in a browser.
